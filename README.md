<h1 align="center"> Hi there 👋 </h1>


<p align="center">
  🧠 Curious mind in a noisy world — I tear into systems, hunt down assumptions, and stitch up security holes.<br>
  👣 From bare-metal boxes to cloud fog — I map, break, and occasionally rebuild.

### 🧷 What I Do
- 🧪 Security testing where logic flaws hide, not just where scanners scream
- 🐚 Infra hardening born from hands-on Linux trenches (LPIC-1/2/303)
- 🛰️ Recon frameworks built for real-world signal, not shiny dashboards
- 🎯 Offense-driven defense — phishing, LVE abuse, dev misconfigs, and more

Here are some ideas to get you started:

### 📡 Current Focus
Working on internal automation tools for bug bounty & exploit workflows.
